        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold pb-5">difference between local storage and session storage</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl">sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in
            localStorage doesn't expire,
            data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular
            tab
            in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold pb-5">difference between global scope and local scope</h2>
        <p class="text-2xl">A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the
            code. Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local
            scope.</p>

        <h2 class="text-5xl font-semibold pb-5">How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript? </h2>
        <p class="text-2xl">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
            Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
            Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
